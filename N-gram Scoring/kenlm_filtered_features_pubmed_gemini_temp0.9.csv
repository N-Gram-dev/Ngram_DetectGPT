Therefore, we",2.3685972735685406e-07,0.13805206262126735,0.029448751486325808,0.018134264647818726,0.15921665077528946,0.016661878770468257,0.018108015409528666,0.1857171457950919,0.0,2.3685972735685406e-07,0.18924199963852795,0.0
299,0.9,7,human,Question: Can mental imagery functional magnetic resonance imaging predict recovery in patients with disorders of consciousness? Answer: The fMRI paradigm mental imagery displays a high concordance with the further clinical course of patients in a VS. All 5 patients in a VS who showed significant activation of ROIs had a favorable further course until the end of the observation period. We therefore,"Question: Does mental imagery fMRI help in predicting recovery for patients with disorders of consciousness? Answer: The mental imagery fMRI paradigm is closely aligned with the further clinical progression of vegetative state patients. Every one of the five VS patients with notable ROI activation had a favorable clinical course during the entire observation period. Hence, we",1.4211583641411244e-07,0.11097832379930672,0.0053151538391179864,0.010880558788691236,0.10792772743767642,0.0018500471818279247,0.0108648092457172,0.10724553035359774,0.0,1.4211583641411244e-07,0.10919929196499112,0.0
299,0.9,8,human,Question: Can mental imagery functional magnetic resonance imaging predict recovery in patients with disorders of consciousness? Answer: The fMRI paradigm mental imagery displays a high concordance with the further clinical course of patients in a VS. All 5 patients in a VS who showed significant activation of ROIs had a favorable further course until the end of the observation period. We therefore,"Question: Can mental imagery-based functional MRI serve as a predictor for recovery in patients with consciousness disorders? Answer: The fMRI mental imagery paradigm provides strong agreement with the clinical progression seen in VS patients. All five patients in a vegetative state who showed significant activation in ROIs had favorable outcomes throughout the observation period. Therefore, we",1.4211583641411244e-07,0.03536226773822193,0.0490487514863258,0.010880558788691236,0.08225560963915957,0.016661878770468257,0.0108648092457172,0.10724553035359774,0.0,1.4211583641411244e-07,0.10919929196499112,0.0
299,0.9,9,human,Question: Can mental imagery functional magnetic resonance imaging predict recovery in patients with disorders of consciousness? Answer: The fMRI paradigm mental imagery displays a high concordance with the further clinical course of patients in a VS. All 5 patients in a VS who showed significant activation of ROIs had a favorable further course until the end of the observation period. We therefore,"Question: Is it possible to forecast recovery in patients with disorders of consciousness using mental imagery fMRI? Answer: The mental imagery paradigm in fMRI corresponds closely with the clinical trajectory for VS patients. Each of the five patients in VS with significant ROI activation had a positive clinical course up to the end of the study period. Thus, we",7.105791820705622e-08,0.030055696255994135,0.014609975976121715,0.005440279394345618,0.02818838836888471,0.016661878770468257,0.0054324046228586,0.05218575317056917,0.0,7.105791820705622e-08,0.05310982531394792,0.0
299,0.9,10,human,Question: Can mental imagery functional magnetic resonance imaging predict recovery in patients with disorders of consciousness? Answer: The fMRI paradigm mental imagery displays a high concordance with the further clinical course of patients in a VS. All 5 patients in a VS who showed significant activation of ROIs had a favorable further course until the end of the observation period. We therefore,"Question: Can mental imagery fMRI predict prognosis for patients with disorders of consciousness? Answer: The fMRI paradigm using mental imagery correlates strongly with the further clinical outcomes in VS patients. All five VS patients showing significant activation in ROIs exhibited favorable progression throughout the observation duration. Hence, we",3.316036182995957e-07,0.2220434759653136,0.0277822108436037,0.025387970506946217,0.24259825971434035,0.016661878770468257,0.025351221573340132,0.2708749541353992,0.0,3.316036182995957e-07,0.2762533766281572,0.0
