189,0.3,6,human,Question: Aromatase inhibitor-related musculoskeletal symptoms: is preventing osteoporosis the key to eliminating these symptoms? Answer: Patients on AIs who develop osteoporosis are at increased risk of musculoskeletal symptoms and bone fracture. Comedication with Ca/Bis reduces the likelihood for osteoporosis and musculoskeletal symptoms. Patients who received tamoxifen before AIs were less likely to develop AI-related musculoskeletal symptoms. We recommend,Question: Can preventing osteoporosis effectively reduce musculoskeletal symptoms related to aromatase inhibitors? Answer: Osteoporosis increases the risk of musculoskeletal symptoms and fractures in patients on AIs. Calcium and bisphosphonate co-treatment reduces this risk. Patients previously treated with tamoxifen are less likely to develop these AI-related symptoms.
