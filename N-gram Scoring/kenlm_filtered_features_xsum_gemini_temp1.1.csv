Defender Debuchy, who just returned from three months out with an ankle injury, had an operation on a shoulder he dislocated in the win over Stoke. Boss Arsene Wenger described Debuchy's injury on Sunday as ""unbelievable"". ""It's very unfortunate,"" said the Frenchman. ""It's unbelievable because he's had two surgeries in the same season. He just came back, he played seven games and he's out again."" Debuchy has played just 14 times since signing from Newcastle in July in a deal worth a reported £12m.

The changes would allow Japanese troops to fight abroad for the first time since World War Two. The legislation has already been passed by Japan's lower house.

It would allow the country's Self-Defense Forces (SDF) to engage in collective self-defense, meaning they could fight alongside allies even if Japan itself is not directly attacked.

The legislation has sparked controversy, with some arguing it will increase the risk of Japan being dragged into foreign conflicts.

The service, like Siri on iPhones, allows users to interact with their device using voice commands, making tasks like setting alarms, sending messages, and controlling smart home devices effortless.

Charles Mumbere, the king of Rwenzururu, is entitled to these privileges because he suffers from hypertension and diabetes, it added. But the decision to grant him access to a private hospital for treatment has sparked controversy. Critics argue that Mumbere, who is facing charges of treason and murder, should be treated in a public hospital like any other prisoner. 

The government has defended its decision, stating that Mumbere's health condition requires specialized care available only at the designated facility. However, the move has fueled concerns about unequal access to healthcare and potential preferential treatment for high-profile individuals. The debate is expected to intensify as Mumbere's trial continues.

Borrowing the names of organisations like NASA and the Environmental Protection Agency, protesters are directly attacking the president. Mr. Trump has called climate change a ""hoax,"" sparking widespread outrage and protests across the country. Demonstrators, armed with signs reading ""Science is Real"" and ""Believe Scientists,"" are demanding action on climate change and criticizing the Trump administration's environmental policies. 

The recent wave of protests comes as a new report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns that the world is on track for catastrophic warming by the end of the century. The report, which was compiled by over 100 scientists from around the globe, calls for urgent action to curb greenhouse gas emissions. While the Trump administration has dismissed the report, the protesters are determined to make their voices heard and demand change. 
","""Hoax"" or ""Disaster""? Climate Change Controversy Intensifies with Fresh Criticisms
Activists are leveraging the names of organizations such as NASA and the Environmental Protection Agency to confront the president head-on. President Trump has labeled climate change a ""hoax,"" igniting widespread backlash and national demonstrations. Marchers wield signs proclaiming ""Science is Real"" and ""Trust Scientists,"" calling for action on climate change and condemning the administration’s environmental stances.

This latest surge of protests coincides with a recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report warning the planet faces catastrophic warming by century’s end.

**London, UK** - Ben Butler met a psychologist in 2004 after assaulting a man in a nightclub. Dr Tim Green wrote Mr Butler found it ""difficult to control his anger and sometimes reacted to situations in an impulsive and aggressive manner."" This information, revealed during Butler's trial for the murder of his daughter, Ellie, has sparked renewed debate about the role of anger management in domestic violence and child abuse. 

Butler, who was acquitted of Ellie's murder in 2010, was found guilty this week after new evidence emerged. He was sentenced to 23 years in prison. The case highlights the complex nature of domestic violence and the need for thorough assessments and interventions, particularly when children are involved.
