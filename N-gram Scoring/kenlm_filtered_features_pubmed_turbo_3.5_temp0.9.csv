189,0.9,9,human,Question: Aromatase inhibitor-related musculoskeletal symptoms: is preventing osteoporosis the key to eliminating these symptoms? Answer: Patients on AIs who develop osteoporosis are at increased risk of musculoskeletal symptoms and bone fracture. Comedication with Ca/Bis reduces the likelihood for osteoporosis and musculoskeletal symptoms. Patients who received tamoxifen before AIs were less likely to develop AI-related musculoskeletal symptoms. We recommend,Question: Does preventing osteoporosis play a central role in alleviating musculoskeletal symptoms caused by aromatase inhibitors? Answer: AI-treated patients who develop osteoporosis face higher risks of musculoskeletal symptoms and bone fractures. Co-treatment with calcium and bisphosphonates reduces this likelihood. Tamoxifen administration prior to AI use decreases symptom incidence. We suggest,1.8948778188548325e-07,0.15520173767557388,0.002861040249433105,0.014507411718254981,0.1541506798272585,0.0,0.014486412327622933,0.15718558352241319,0.0,1.8948778188548325e-07,0.16034265007518078,0.0
189,0.9,10,human,Question: Aromatase inhibitor-related musculoskeletal symptoms: is preventing osteoporosis the key to eliminating these symptoms? Answer: Patients on AIs who develop osteoporosis are at increased risk of musculoskeletal symptoms and bone fracture. Comedication with Ca/Bis reduces the likelihood for osteoporosis and musculoskeletal symptoms. Patients who received tamoxifen before AIs were less likely to develop AI-related musculoskeletal symptoms. We recommend,Question: Is the prevention of osteoporosis critical for reducing musculoskeletal symptoms associated with aromatase inhibitors? Answer: Osteoporosis in patients on AIs increases their risk of musculoskeletal symptoms and fractures. Co-prescribing calcium and bisphosphonates mitigates these risks. Prior tamoxifen usage also lowers AI-related musculoskeletal symptom development.
