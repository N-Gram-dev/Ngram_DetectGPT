The hashtag #penuriecarburantdansunfilm, which translates as ""fuel shortage in a film"", became France's top Twitter trend on Wednesday, as the ongoing fuel crisis sparked online creativity. 

French Twitter users responded to the real-life shortage with a wave of humorous suggestions for how filmmakers could portray a similar situation on screen.  Ideas ranged from using horse-drawn carriages for transportation to depicting futuristic, fuel-less vehicles. 

The trend highlighted the frustration of drivers facing long lines and empty pumps, but also showcased the French public's wit and ability to find humor in even the most difficult situations.  It remains to be seen whether these film-inspired solutions will offer any practical assistance, but they certainly provided a lighthearted escape for those impacted by the fuel crisis.

Transport for London (TfL) is to consult on plans to demand a new English language test, a map-reading assessment, and a fixed landline telephone for all new driving licence applications. The proposed changes, aimed at enhancing road safety and driver competence, have sparked debate. 

The English language test would assess comprehension of road signs and traffic regulations, while the map-reading assessment aims to combat reliance on GPS navigation. The requirement for a fixed landline phone is intended to improve communication in emergencies, particularly in areas with limited mobile reception.

Jetha is currently in custody awaiting trial. The victim's family is seeking justice and calling for increased accountability within the justice system. 
","Last year, a child under 13 needed medical treatment following an assault by Ajay Jetha. A probation report three months earlier had warned of Jetha's dangerousness, citing his history of violent behavior and disregard for court orders.

The amnesty applies to offences committed during the political turmoil after Mr Thaksin was ousted in a coup. The lower house passed the controversial bill in the early hours of Wednesday morning, sparking protests and raising concerns about the potential for impunity. 

The bill, which aims to reconcile the country after years of political instability, covers a wide range of offences, including those related to the 2010 Red Shirt protests and the 2014 military coup. Critics argue that it would allow for the return of exiled politicians, including Mr Thaksin, and could shield those responsible for human rights abuses. 

Supporters, however, maintain that the amnesty is necessary to move the country forward and bring about national unity. The bill now faces a vote in the Senate, with its fate uncertain.

The ambitious project, inspired by the principles of cosmology and the interconnectedness of the universe, transforms a former opencast coal mine into a landscape of dramatic earthworks and reflective pools. 

Jencks, known for his groundbreaking work in architectural theory and landscape design, envisioned the Crawick Multiverse as a place of contemplation and wonder. Visitors can wander through the labyrinthine pathways, explore the different ""universes"" represented by the unique earthworks, and reflect on the vastness of space and time. The site is a testament to the power of art to transform the landscape and inspire new ways of seeing the world.

128,0.5,1,ai,"## New Dads Still Missing Out on Paternity Leave, Survey Finds

A survey of employees and managers found that a quarter of new fathers took no paternity leave at all. Fewer than one in 10 took more than the minimum legally mandated time off. The findings highlight a continued reluctance amongst new dads to prioritize their own wellbeing and the bonding period with their newborns.  

Experts cite a range of factors contributing to this trend, including societal expectations around masculinity, concerns about job security, and inadequate workplace policies. They emphasize the importance of encouraging men to take advantage of paternity leave, arguing that it benefits not only the father, but the entire family and workplace. The survey calls for increased awareness and support for new fathers, urging employers to foster a culture that normalizes and encourages paternity leave.

The game was so poorly received that Atari is said to have buried millions of unsold copies in a landfill in New Mexico. 

The landfill was recently excavated, and the game cartridges were discovered. The discovery has sparked interest in the history of video games, and many people are excited to see what condition the cartridges are in. Some people hope that the cartridges can be sold for a profit, while others hope that they will be donated to museums.

The discovery of the buried game cartridges is a reminder of the fickle nature of the video game industry. What is a commercial flop today could be a valuable collector's item tomorrow.

The charity wants 10% of the 4.8 million Syrians displaced by civil war to be resettled by the end of the year. The ambitious goal, announced yesterday, aims to provide refuge for 480,000 Syrians currently living in precarious conditions in neighboring countries. 

The charity, which has been working tirelessly to assist Syrian refugees since the conflict began in 2011, is calling for increased international cooperation and financial support to achieve this goal. They argue that resettlement is a crucial step in offering long-term solutions for Syrian refugees and providing them with a safe and dignified life. 

The announcement comes amid growing international concern over the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Syria. With the conflict showing no signs of abating, the need for resettlement programs is increasingly urgent.

It also said such groups were more at risk of developing thalassemia, a group of inherited blood disorders that hindered the blood's ability to carry oxygen.

Three unnamed police forces in England and Wales are taking part in a pilot scheme following the study. Coercive or controlling behaviour became a criminal offence last year. The research found that although most domestic abuse incidents were handled in a ""professional"" way, some officers still displayed ""negative and uninformed"" attitudes. In particular, police tended to neglect cases where suspects did not use violence but tried to control their victim in other ways such as by making threats. The report said: ""A tendency for the police to focus on physical violence and what has occurred at the current incident can result in them missing abuse which is characterised not by physical violence and injury but by continuous coercion and control in other forms.""

This was attributed to a number of factors, including better access to high-quality schools, a more diverse range of educational opportunities, and a stronger local economy.

Julia Knight, 56, denies attempting to murder Irene Robson, 81, at Horton Hospital in Banbury in October 2021. The alleged incident occurred during Knight's shift as a nurse at the hospital. 

Knight appeared at Oxford Crown Court today, pleading not guilty to the charge. The prosecution alleges that Knight deliberately administered a lethal dose of medication to Robson, with the intention of causing her death. The defense maintains that Knight's actions were a tragic mistake, resulting from stress and fatigue, and that she had no intention to harm Robson.

The trial is expected to last for two weeks, with several witnesses from the hospital staff and Robson's family expected to testify.

The case highlights the complex nature of domestic violence and the need for thorough assessments and interventions, particularly when children are involved.
