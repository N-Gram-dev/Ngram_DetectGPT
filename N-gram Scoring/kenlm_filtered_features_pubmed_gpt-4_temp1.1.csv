189,1.1,7,human,Question: Aromatase inhibitor-related musculoskeletal symptoms: is preventing osteoporosis the key to eliminating these symptoms? Answer: Patients on AIs who develop osteoporosis are at increased risk of musculoskeletal symptoms and bone fracture. Comedication with Ca/Bis reduces the likelihood for osteoporosis and musculoskeletal symptoms. Patients who received tamoxifen before AIs were less likely to develop AI-related musculoskeletal symptoms. We recommend that patients on AIs,Is osteoporosis prevention essential to avoid AI-related musculoskeletal symptoms? AI users who develop osteoporosis face a higher chance of fractures and bone pain. Co-treatment with calcium and bisphosphonates helps reduce these conditions. Patients previously on tamoxifen show fewer such musculoskeletal complaints. We suggest this approach for patients receiving AIs.,3.079176455639103e-07,0.17149444206280196,0.0490487514863258,0.023574544042164344,0.221092054493377,0.016661878770468257,0.023540420032387266,0.2488960474166242,0.0,3.079176455639103e-07,0.25378052077609947,0.0
