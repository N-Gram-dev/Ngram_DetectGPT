Answer: Men and women in this community sample reported similar patterns of depressive symptoms.

**Answer:** These data indicate that major blunt trauma induces a robust neutrophil migratory response, potentially contributing to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). While further investigation is needed, our findings suggest that targeting neutrophil activation and migration may be a promising therapeutic strategy for ARDS following trauma. 
","Question: Could increased neutrophil traversing activity following severe trauma contribute to acute respiratory distress syndrome etiology?
