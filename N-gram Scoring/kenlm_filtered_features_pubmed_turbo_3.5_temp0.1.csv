Comedication with Ca/Bis reduces the likelihood for osteoporosis and musculoskeletal symptoms. Patients who received tamoxifen before AIs were less likely to develop AI-related musculoskeletal symptoms. We recommend,Question: Are aromatase inhibitor-related musculoskeletal symptoms best prevented by managing osteoporosis?
