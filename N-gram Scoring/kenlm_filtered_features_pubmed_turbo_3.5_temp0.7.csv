Therefore, we",7.105791820705622e-08,0.006154069340134072,0.03181267884859111,0.005440279394345618,0.02818838836888471,0.016661878770468257,0.0054324046228586,0.05218575317056917,0.0,7.105791820705622e-08,0.05310982531394792,0.0
299,0.7,9,human,Question: Can mental imagery functional magnetic resonance imaging predict recovery in patients with disorders of consciousness? Answer: The fMRI paradigm mental imagery displays a high concordance with the further clinical course of patients in a VS. All 5 patients in a VS who showed significant activation of ROIs had a favorable further course until the end of the observation period. We therefore,"Can mental imagery functional magnetic resonance imaging accurately predict recovery in patients with disorders of consciousness? The mental imagery fMRI paradigm reveals strong agreement with the future clinical trajectory of VS patients. Each of the five VS patients demonstrating significant ROI activation experienced a favorable clinical course until the end of the monitoring period. Hence, we",1.4211583641411244e-07,0.08577297177894527,0.012736896733744812,0.010880558788691236,0.08225560963915957,0.016661878770468257,0.0108648092457172,0.10724553035359774,0.0,1.4211583641411244e-07,0.10919929196499112,0.0
299,0.7,10,human,Question: Can mental imagery functional magnetic resonance imaging predict recovery in patients with disorders of consciousness? Answer: The fMRI paradigm mental imagery displays a high concordance with the further clinical course of patients in a VS. All 5 patients in a VS who showed significant activation of ROIs had a favorable further course until the end of the observation period. We therefore,"Is mental imagery functional MRI capable of forecasting recovery in patients with disorders of consciousness? The mental imagery fMRI paradigm exhibits a high level of concordance with the later clinical progression of patients in a vegetative state. All five VS patients who showed considerable activation in regions of interest had a positive course through the observation timeline. Therefore, we",7.105791820705622e-08,0.006154069340134072,0.03181267884859111,0.005440279394345618,0.02818838836888471,0.016661878770468257,0.0054324046228586,0.05218575317056917,0.0,7.105791820705622e-08,0.05310982531394792,0.0
