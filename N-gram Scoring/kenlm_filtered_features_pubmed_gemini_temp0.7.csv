Patients who received tamoxifen before AIs were less likely to develop AI-related musculoskeletal symptoms. We recommend,Is the key to preventing aromatase inhibitor-related musculoskeletal symptoms found in osteoporosis prevention? Osteoporosis in patients on AIs increases the likelihood of musculoskeletal symptoms and bone fractures. Supplementing with calcium and bisphosphonates decreases these risks. Prior tamoxifen therapy reduces the occurrence of AI-induced musculoskeletal symptoms.

189,0.7,9,human,Question: Aromatase inhibitor-related musculoskeletal symptoms: is preventing osteoporosis the key to eliminating these symptoms? Answer: Patients on AIs who develop osteoporosis are at increased risk of musculoskeletal symptoms and bone fracture. Comedication with Ca/Bis reduces the likelihood for osteoporosis and musculoskeletal symptoms. Patients who received tamoxifen before AIs were less likely to develop AI-related musculoskeletal symptoms. We recommend,Is stopping osteoporosis the key to eliminating aromatase inhibitor-associated musculoskeletal symptoms? Patients on AI therapy developing osteoporosis are more prone to musculoskeletal symptoms and fractures. Co-treatment with calcium and bisphosphonates reduces the risk of both osteoporosis and musculoskeletal issues. Prior tamoxifen use decreases AI-related musculoskeletal symptoms.

More research is needed to better understand the complex relationship between aging and health inequities in Indigenous Australians.,1.1842986367842703e-07,0.09688427063008742,0.015621063240110858,0.009067132323909363,0.0763729787845735,0.0,0.009054007704764333,0.07755823434587317,0.0,1.1842986367842703e-07,0.07878087785311383,0.0

Answer: The idea that Indigenous people age prematurely is not well supported by this study of a series of discrete conditions.  While there are higher rates of chronic disease in some Indigenous communities, these are largely due to social and environmental factors, not a faster aging process.  Further research is needed to understand the complex relationship between aging and health disparities in Indigenous Australians.

Based on this study of various specific conditions, there is insufficient support for the notion that Indigenous Australians age prematurely.
